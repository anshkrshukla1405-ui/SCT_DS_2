# SCT_DS_2
Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains my work for SkillCraft Technology Task 2, where I perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

The project covers:

Loading and cleaning the dataset (handling missing values, dropping irrelevant columns)

Visualizing survival patterns by gender, passenger class, and age distribution

Drawing insights about factors affecting survival in the Titanic disaster

This notebook demonstrates basic data science techniques using Python libraries like pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.
